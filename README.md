# ðŸ“° All the News That's Fit to Scrape

### Overview
In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

### Usage
1. At the top of the page, click __Scrape__. 'Scrape finished' will be displayed at the top of the screen. 
2. Navigate back. At this point, you can click __Articles__ at the top of the page to see a JSON object view of the scraped articles, or click one of the articles listed in the center of the page.
2. Clicking a headline will bring up the __Note box__ on the right side of the screen.
3. Within the fields of this box, you can enter a note about the article. Clicking __Save Note__ will save the note to that article. Clicking the headline again will reveal the saved note.
